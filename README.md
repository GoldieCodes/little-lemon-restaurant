## List of self created components

The following are the components I created that are not top level in the 'components' folder, but are embedded in other files:

1. FormSubmitBtn
   Location: import { FormSubmitBtn } from "@/components/LoginOrCreateAccountTemplate"
   Description: This should be used in place of the regular submit button on forms. It incoporates the loading spinner indicator logic, and is well styled.
